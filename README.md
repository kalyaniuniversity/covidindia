# covdata.covidindia Module

**Description**

This covidindia Module has the power to bring all the data related to Covid-19 outbreak in India in a tabular form. This module will bring the whole set of raw data in a date-wise and processed format from [the COVID-19 Indian Dataset maintained by University of Kalyani](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/COVID-19-Datasets), which will be easier to deal with.

Once installed, we can get an up-to-date information about the Covid-19 affected people, till the day the data is available at the source. We can visualize the data of our choice for any given range of dates. It is capable of giving information about the total number of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients, between any two dates, of any city, district or related to any particular gender (male/female). We can also visualize the whole up-to-date data without using any aforesaid filters using our module.

# How it works?

It gathers information from our own maintained database. Database data are collected from various websites, news channels and [covid19india.org crowdsourcing initiative](https://www.covid19india.org). From the collected data this module will help user to represent in user friendly format with all types of filters in one place. No need to search any website. Just use this module for India based Covid-19 projects.

## Installation

     pip install covdata

## What's new!!

- Some changes in covdata server.

## Up the server

     covdata cov-server   #to start the server with default port
     covdata cov-server -b :8000      #to bind the port at 8000

## Usage

     #import module
     from covdata.covidindia import *

     #Initialize the module to collect the data
     Init=initializer()

     #shows the collected data in Dataframe format of Total Confimed data as daily count basis. If daily is not mentioned cumulative data will be shown.

     Init.show_data(of='Total Confirmed',daily=True)

     obj1=Data(init)       #defining the object for Data class
     cumData=obj1.get_cum_dataset_between_date('30/1/2020','5/4/2020',by='total recovered')   #gives the cumulative count between 30/1/2020 and 5/4/2020

     obj1.rank(10,'Total Confirmed',kind='top',cummulative=True,date='4/3/2020')   #gives the top 10 total confirmed cases for date 4/3/2020

     obj2=Demographic_overview(init)     # object for demographic_overview class

     obj2.demography('Salt Lake','30/1/2020-10/4/2020')    #Gives Male and Female counts of confirmed cases for salt lake city in west bengal between 30/1/2020 and 10/4/2020

     obj3=visualizer(init)       #initiazing visualizer class

     obj3.whole(daily=True)       #shows line plot for daily counts of confirmed cases,recovered cases and death cases against date.

## Examples

Examples are in [github](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/covidindia) repository project folder.

A website has been created that will show the required data of Covid-19 in india and some graphs are added.From that website each and every single data can de downloaded.

See [covdataserver](https://covdata.pythonanywhere.com/)

     #get top 10 values of Total Recovered cases as cumulative counts for any date
     covdata -r top -n 10 -f Total_Recovered -D n --options rank -d 15/3/2020

     #get top 10 values of Total Recovered cases as cumulative counts for all dates if date is not mentioned
     covdata -r top -n 10 -f Total_Recovered -D n --options rank

     #get cumulative data between two given dates
     covdata -d 15/3/2020-30/3/2020 -f Total_Recovered --options cumulative_between_date     #Total recovered cumulative data between 15/3/2020 and 30/3/2020

     #get daily count between two dates
     covdata -d 15/3/2020-30/3/2020 -f Total_Confirmed --options count_between_date   #Daily count data between 15/3/2020 and 30/3/2020

     #graph of whole data
     covdata -g whole -D y --options graph    #plot the whole data with dailly counts

     #graph whole data of any state
     covdata -g whole -D y -s wb --options graph    #plots the daily graph of west bengal

     #graph of 1st n data of any selected state ,if state not mentioned all together state count will be shown
     covdata -g head -n 15 -D y -s wb --options graph   #plots 1st 15 days daily counts for west bengal
     covdata -g tail -n 15 -D n -s wb --options graph   #plots last 15 days cumulative counts for west bengal

     #get a daily or cumulative graph between two dates for any states
     covdata -g graph_by_date -d 25/3/2020-4/4/2020 -D y -s mh --options graph

     #if state is not mentioned graph is shown for all states together
     covdata -g graph_by_date -d 25/3/2020-4/4/2020 -D y --options graph

     #latitude vs confirmed cases
     covdata -g latitude --options graph

     #similarly -g tail will work same and please use state code.Terminal feature demonstrates some methods only that are written in --options flag(type 'covdata -h' to see options). -H -T and --save flag can be used for every method that returns a dataframe not a graph.
